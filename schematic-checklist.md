# Schematic review checklist

## 1 Document Setup
* [ ] 1.1 Is there a method for tracking versions/revisions?	
* [ ] 1.2 Is source version control used? (Git, SVN, etc.)

1.3 Are design decisions well documented?	
- * [ ] 1.3.1 Within or separate from the schematic/drawings?	\n\n
* [ ] 1.4 Has ERC been set up and configured?	
* [ ] 1.5 Has grid size been selected?	
* [ ] 1.6 Has paper sizes been selected for sheets?	


## 2 Schematic
### 2.1 Symbols
- * [ ] 2.1.1 Are explicit and informative	
- * [ ] 2.1.2 Do they resemble electrical circuit symbols?
- * [ ] 2.1.3 Reflect the functionality or logical structure of the component?	
- * [ ] 2.1.4 Pins are assigned the correct type (passive, power in, out, etc.)?	
- * [ ] 2.1.5 Pin numbers are identical to datasheet or external interface specification document	
- * [ ] 2.1.6 Are active-high and active-low marked consistently?	
- * [ ] 2.1.7 Do pin positions adhere to the selected grid size?	
- * [ ] 2.1.8 Do symbols match chosen component package?	
- * [ ] 2.1.9 Are datasheets included with each symbol?	
### 2.2 Functionality
- 2.2.1 Are all pins on all ICs handled?	
- * [ ] 2.2.1.1 Beak-out of extra pins from ICs or subsystems?	
- * [ ] 2.2.2 Are mating connectors on different boards matched in pin-out?	
- * [ ] 2.2.3 Have necessary inputs been ESD protected?	
- * [ ] 2.2.4 Multipart components are identified and utilized
